**Thoughts:** C# is slighty more complex compared to JavaScript in that it has structs

### Day 22: May 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a program in C# that translates a word into Pig Latin and learned how to make an array in C#

**Thoughts:** C# is really similar to JavaScript. The syntax is just slightly different and C# is a more stronger language.

**Thoughts:** Hopefully this will go well...

**Thoughts:** It feels great using what I learned in the beginner and some from the intermediate class and applying it to a real life project that we could potentially win money on!

### Day 25: May 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Although I only got 2 hours of sleep with my teammates getting even less than me, we didn't completely finish the project. But we complete enough to wow the judges and got 3rd place out of 15 teams! 

**Thoughts:** It was a great experience and I feel like this is one of my first steps to becoming a professional web developer. I got valuable experience from working on this project and I won $150 dollars! 

### Day 26: May 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Practical Javacsript course, currently making Version 4 of the Todolist program
